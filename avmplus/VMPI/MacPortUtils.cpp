        one of the way to find the page size by looking into size of a vm
     
        size vm_size_t 2326528
        info vm_region_top_info_data_t
        obj_id unsigned int 1920607759
        ref_count unsigned int 12
        private_pages_resident unsigned int 0
        shared_pages_resident unsigned int 568
        share_mode unsigned char '' 'â€™
     
        We can see the size of this VM section is 2326528 which is equal to (private_pages_resident + shared_pages_resident)* 4*1024.  Here we are calculating the page number of size 4K by divinding the vm size to total number of private pages and shared pasges. However this approach is not working in case of HMAOT, hence hardcoding the page size to 4K for iOS 64 bit as currently I don't find any suitable way for the same. 
     
      In case of HMAOT :
        (private_pages_resident + shared_pages_resident)* 4*1024 > vm_size
