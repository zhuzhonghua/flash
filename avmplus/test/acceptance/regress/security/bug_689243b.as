// On 64-bit systems this will normally crash in all build modes,
// though it's not a sure thing.

// On 32-bit systems this will corrupt the heap in ways not easily
// detected.  The GC invocation usually causes a crash; beyond that,
// we should get an assertion in Debug builds because we corrupt the
// poison before the object.  In release builds it's not so easy to
// say.

// In a system with the bug fix we should get a reliable exception and
// the state of the object should be unchanged.

// Really only works with the JIT, since otherwise 0xFFFFFFFF is
// converted to some boxed Number and a different path is taken.  So
// wrap the test in a function here to trigger jitting in simplistic
// (jit on first invocation) situations, but generally for
// future-proofing (OSR) the test should be set up for a -Ojit-only
// run.
